<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Hi üëã, I'm ruoyu.

‚≠êThis is my personal website codebase. Please star it if you like the site.

üôãThere are many website generators or frameworks like WordPress, gatsby, Jekyll, Hexo etc. You may be wondering why I build a personal website from the ground.

üë®‚ÄçüíªAs a junior developer, I'd like to utilize what I've leaned to build web applications especially with some cool and new technologies. This personal website is one of them.

‚òÄÔ∏èI believe that building and maintaining a personal website help me stay creative and active, and it may bring me more opportunities for landing a job or running a business. Another reason is that it drives me to write tech related posts and record colourful life. 

‚ù§Ô∏èI wish you like the site. if you have any question or suggestion, please, do not hesitate, leave a comment.
